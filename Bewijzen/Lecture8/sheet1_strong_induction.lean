-- Bridge (goal): rewrite under a sum using the strong induction hypothesis,
-- c + ∑_{k≤n} b k = c + ∑_{k≤n} g k when b k = g k for all k ≤ n.  The
-- hypothesis carries the `k ≥ 0` side condition that the strong induction
-- announcement puts on the induction hypothesis, so the Calc step can cite the
-- induction hypothesis in exactly the form the student sees it.

-- Bridges for reaching back to an earlier value in a strong induction step:
-- they let the step work directly with `m - d`, the value the argument actually
-- looks back at, instead of first reindexing `m` as `p + c`.  The first two are
-- general in the offset `d` and the lower bound `l`, and supply the two side
-- conditions the strong induction hypothesis asks for; the third puts back the
-- coins that were taken off.

-- Bridge (goal): if m is at least l + d, then m - d is still at least l — the
-- lower-bound side condition of the induction hypothesis.

#doc (WaterproofGenre) "Strong induction — sequences, recursive definitions, and coin sums" =>

You can start a proof by strong induction using `Let's proceed by strong induction on m`, which
creates the base case and the induction step
`∀ m, (∀ k ≤ m, k ≥ <lower bound> → <claim for k>) → <claim for m + 1>`. When
several base cases are needed, list their values after `with base cases`, with
the values separated by commas and `and`:

`Let's proceed by strong induction on m, with base cases 0 and 1`

This creates the goals for `m = 0` and `m = 1` and a step goal that starts at
`m ≥ 1`, so the step only has to work from the first value where the
recurrence applies. The same announcement works on a goal `∀ m ≥ 3, ...` with
`with base cases 3, 4 and 5`.

Example "4.3.4"
  Given: (b : ℕ → ℕ)
  Assume: (_ : b 0 = 1) (_ : ∀ (n : ℕ), b (n + 1) = 1 + ∑ k ∈ [0, n], b k)
  Conclusion: ∀ n : ℕ, b n = 2 ^ n
Proof:
  Let's proceed by strong induction on n
  · Calc
      b 0 = 1 by hypothesis
      _ = 2 ^ 0 by computation
  · Fix n
    Assume that ∀ k ≤ n, b k = 2 ^ k
    Calc
      b (n + 1) = 1 + ∑ k ∈ [0, n], b k
          since ∀ p : ℕ, b (p + 1) = 1 + ∑ k ∈ [0, p], b k
      _ = 1 + ∑ k ∈ [0, n], 2 ^ k since ∀ k ≤ n, b k = 2 ^ k
      _ = 1 + (2 ^ (n + 1) - 1) since ∑ k ∈ [0, n], 2 ^ k = 2 ^ (n + 1) - 1
      _ = 2 ^ (n + 1) by computation
